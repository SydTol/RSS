    "Robots encounter many uncertainties when operating in the real world. These uncertainties are contributed to from a number of factors, such as unpredictable environments, sensor limitations and robot actuations. For example, a robot moving through its environment will accumulate errors in odometry, gradually making it less certain of where it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of this problem is in robot localization, where a robot must estimate it's coordinates relative to an external reference frame. The robot is given a map of its environment, but in order to localize itself relative to this map it needs sensor input. Learning maps is a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem, for which it is often referred to as  *simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)*.\n",
    " \n",
    "Some of the factors influencing the difficulty of a SLAM problem are:\n",
    "* Size - The larger the environment relative to the robot’s perceptual range, the more difficult it is to acquire a map.\n",
    "* Noise in perception and actuation - If robot sensors and actuators were noise-free, mapping would be a simple problem. The larger the noise, the more difficult the problem.\n",
    "* Perceptual ambiguity - The more frequently different places look alike, the more difficult it is to establish correspondence between different locations traversed at different points in time."
